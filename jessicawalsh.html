		<h2> WALSH is the founder of design firm, & WALSH. She experiments with vibrant colors and patterns. I appreciate her retro tough to modern design. Her work references elements from the 1950s. I am most interested in the work she has done with the Zumtobel Annual Report. Zumtobel is a lighting manufacturer based in Austria. The company asked to incorporate light and shadow in their design. & Walsh incorporates vibrant colors, book design, and contemporary typography. Together, & Walsh created 20 typographic prints. I found the "Z" packaging both necessary and stylistically interesting.
