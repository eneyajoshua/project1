		<h2> BRANDENBERGER experiments with motion in graphic design. The work he does involves personified qualities that I wouldn't necessarily expect from a graphic designer. He shows lively text combinations by using time based media and shading to create texture. In his most recent work he has created album promotion art works for DJ Snake's single titled, "No More". BRANDENBERG's work showed me how limitless graphic design can be. There are always new ways to push an idea further by referring back to nature and living forms. I am inspired by the intuitive qualities of his works and wish to explore motion graphics further as a tool.
