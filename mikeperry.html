		<h2> MIKE PERRY is responsible for the title sequences for the show Broad City. He does a lot of work with motion graphics and illustration. I appreciate his illustration style and color pairings. PERRY's work can be described as busy but orchestrated. I hope to be able to achieve this style of organized chaos. Aside from Broad City, PERRY has worked on projects for Tidal Magazine, Ray-Ban, and many more.
